# Telemetry with OpenTelemetry and Micrometer

This sample will show you how you can:

- generate traces with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and collect and visualize them with [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
- automatically collect metrics from infrastructure, server endpoints and client libraries with [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io)
  and visualize them with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)

For this, this sample uses the Open Telemetry Java Agent, which dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from
several popular [libraries and frameworks](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation).

In order to visualize and analyze the traces and metrics, we use
[OpenTelemetry exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/exporters/) to export data into the Jaeger
tracing backend and a Prometheus endpoint.

## Run the sample

We will use a single docker-compose to run the consumer, the provider, and a Jaeger backend.
Let's have a look to the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml). We created a consumer and a provider service with
entry points specifying the OpenTelemetry Java Agent as a JVM parameter.
In addition, the [Jaeger exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md#jaeger-exporter)
is configured using environmental variables as required by OpenTelemetry. The
[Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md#prometheus-exporter)
is configured to expose a Prometheus metrics endpoint.

To run the consumer, the provider, and Jaeger execute the following commands in the project root folder:

Build the connector
```bash
./gradlew :advanced:advanced-01-open-telemetry:open-telemetry-runtime:build
```

Start the docker compose
```bash
docker compose -f advanced/advanced-01-open-telemetry/docker-compose.yaml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

Open a new terminal.

Create an asset:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -d @transfer/transfer-01-negotiation/resources/create-asset.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:19193/management/v3/assets \
  -s | jq
```

Create a Policy on the provider connector:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -d @transfer/transfer-01-negotiation/resources/create-policy.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:19193/management/v3/policydefinitions \
  -s | jq
```

Follow up with the creation of a contract definition:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -d @transfer/transfer-01-negotiation/resources/create-contract-definition.json \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' http://localhost:19193/management/v3/contractdefinitions \
  -s | jq
```

The typical flow requires fetching the catalog from the consumer side and using the contract offer to negotiate a
contract. However, in this sample case, we already have the provider asset `assetId` so we can get the related dataset
directly with this call:

```shell
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @advanced/advanced-01-open-telemetry/resources/get-dataset.json \
  -X POST "http://localhost:29193/management/v3/catalog/dataset/request" \
  -s | jq
```

The output will be something like:

```json
{
  "@id": "assetId",
  "@type": "dcat:Dataset",
  "odrl:hasPolicy": {
    "@id": "MQ==:YXNzZXRJZA==:NjdlNDFhM2EtYThjMS00YTBmLWFkNmYtMjk5NzkzNTE2OTE3",
    "@type": "odrl:Offer",
    "odrl:permission": [],
    "odrl:prohibition": [],
    "odrl:obligation": []
  },
  "dcat:distribution": [
    {
      "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
      "dct:format": {
        "@id": "HttpData-PULL"
      },
      "dcat:accessService": {
        "@id": "cb701b36-48ee-4132-8436-dba7b83c606c",
        "@type": "dcat:DataService",
        "dcat:endpointDescription": "dspace:connector",
        "dcat:endpointUrl": "http://provider:19194/protocol",
        "dct:terms": "dspace:connector",
        "dct:endpointUrl": "http://provider:19194/protocol"
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
      "dct:format": {
        "@id": "HttpData-PUSH"
      },
      "dcat:accessService": {
        "@id": "cb701b36-48ee-4132-8436-dba7b83c606c",
        "@type": "dcat:DataService",
        "dcat:endpointDescription": "dspace:connector",
        "dcat:endpointUrl": "http://provider:19194/protocol",
        "dct:terms": "dspace:connector",
        "dct:endpointUrl": "http://provider:19194/protocol"
      }
    }
  ],
  "name": "product description",
  "id": "assetId",
  "contenttype": "application/json",
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "dcat": "http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/",
    "dspace": "https://w3id.org/dspace/v0.8/"
  }
}

```

With the `odrl:hasPolicy/@id` we can now replace it in the [negotiate-contract.json](resources/negotiate-contract.json) file
and request the contract negotiation:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @advanced/advanced-01-open-telemetry/resources/negotiate-contract.json \
  -X POST "http://localhost:29193/management/v3/contractnegotiations" \
  -s | jq
```

At this point the contract agreement should already been issued, to verify that, please check the contract negotiation
state with this call, replacing `{{contract-negotiation-id}}` with the id returned by the negotiate contract call.

```shell
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: password' \
  -X GET "http://localhost:29193/management/v3/contractnegotiations/{{contract-negotiation-id}}" \
  -s | jq
```

Finally, update the contract agreement id in the [start-transfer.json](resources/start-transfer.json) and execute a file transfer with the following command:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @advanced/advanced-01-open-telemetry/resources/start-transfer.json \
  -X POST "http://localhost:29193/management/v3/transferprocesses" \
  -s | jq
```

You can access the Jaeger UI on your browser at `http://localhost:16686`. In the search tool, we can select the service
`consumer` and click on `Find traces`. A trace represents an event and is composed of several spans. You can inspect
details on the spans contained in a trace by clicking on it in the Jaeger UI.

Example contract negotiation trace:
![Contract negotiation](attachments/contract-negotiation-trace.png)

Example file transfer trace:
![File transfer](attachments/file-transfer-trace.png)

OkHttp and Jetty are part of the [libraries and frameworks](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation)
that OpenTelemetry can capture telemetry from. We can observe spans related to OkHttp and Jetty as EDC uses both
frameworks internally. The `otel.library.name` tag of the different spans indicates the framework each span is coming from.

You can access the Prometheus UI on your browser at `http://localhost:9090`. Click the globe icon near the top right
corner (Metrics Explorer) and select a metric to display. Metrics include System (e.g. CPU usage), JVM (e.g. memory usage),
Executor service (call timings and thread pools), and the instrumented OkHttp, Jetty and Jersey libraries (HTTP client and server).

## Using another monitoring backend

Other monitoring backends can be plugged in easily with OpenTelemetry. For instance, if you want to use Azure Application
Insights instead of Jaeger, you can replace the OpenTelemetry Java Agent with the
[Application Insights Java Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent#download-the-jar-file),
which has to be stored in the root folder of this sample as well. The only additional configuration required are the
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_ROLE_NAME` env variables:

```yaml
  consumer:
    build:
      context: ../..
      dockerfile: advanced/advanced-01-open-telemetry/open-telemetry-consumer/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./:/resources
    ports:
      - "9191:9191"
      - "9192:9192"
    environment:
      APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING: <your-connection-string>
      APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_ROLE_NAME: consumer
      # optional: increase log verbosity (default level is INFO)
      APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_LOGGING_LEVEL: DEBUG
      EDC_HOSTNAME: consumer
      OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: consumer
      OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER: jaeger
      OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT: http://jaeger:14250
      OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER: prometheus
      WEB_HTTP_PORT: 9191
      WEB_HTTP_PATH: /api
      WEB_HTTP_MANAGEMENT_PORT: 9192
      WEB_HTTP_MANAGEMENT_PATH: /management
      WEB_HTTP_MANAGEMENT_AUTH_KEY: password
      WEB_HTTP_PROTOCOL_PORT: 9292
      WEB_HTTP_PROTOCOL_PATH: /protocol
      EDC_DSP_CALLBACK_ADDRESS: http://consumer:9292/protocol
      EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID: consumer
    entrypoint: java
      -javaagent:/resources/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
      -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/resources/logging.properties
      -jar /app/connector.jar
```

The Application Insights Java agent will automatically collect metrics from Micrometer, without any configuration needed.

## Provide your own OpenTelemetry implementation

In order to provide your own OpenTelemetry implementation, you have to "deploy an OpenTelemetry service provider on the class path":

- Create a module containing your OpenTelemetry implementation.
- Add a file in the resource directory META-INF/services. The file should be called `io.opentelemetry.api.OpenTelemetry`.
- Add to the file the fully qualified name of your custom OpenTelemetry implementation class.

EDC uses a [ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
to load an implementation of OpenTelemetry. If it finds an OpenTelemetry service provider on the class path it will use
it, otherwise it will use the registered global OpenTelemetry. You can look at the section
`Deploying service providers on the class path` of the
[ServiceLoader documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
to have more information about service providers.
